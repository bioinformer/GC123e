Significance of HM: Harmonic Mean of a Set of Entropy values: It is a Dimensionless Quantity; being the Ratio of "Mutual Information to the Complement of Normalized Variation of Information" ( Reference Link= https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/393386/why-not-normalizing-mutual-information-with-harmonic-mean-of-entropies )
