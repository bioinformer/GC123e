TCBShE= Triplet Codon Block Shannon Entropy in terms of GC(1,2,3)% equates to Napier’s Constant for Model Organisms, and Harmonically Averages to Same Approximately: a Penta-Clado-genic Quantitative Survey across ~14.45 million Transcripts Grouped-by 1118 Species

Significance of HM: Harmonic Mean of a Set of Entropy values: It can be Expressed as; the Ratio of "Mutual Information to the Complement of Normalized Variation of Information" ( Reference Link= https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/393386/why-not-normalizing-mutual-information-with-harmonic-mean-of-entropies )

An Explanation of Triplet-Block Entropy concept using "Biased" Coin-Toss with Probability(P) of Heads(H) = (1/4) and P of Tails(T) = (3/4) with 2^3=8 Binary states 0=H,1=T.

NOTE: In the Classic Example outlined in Youtube video above, Overall Triplet-Block Entropy= 2.45 > (3 X 0.81 = 2.43). Hence what we calculated is an Over-estimate.
Similarly, this leads to our Bold Hypothesis that Actual/ Expected TCBShE after Error-correction= 
(e/3)*3 = NAPIER's constant (Upto 5 Decimal Places)= 2.71828 , which is what is the EXACT estimate.
